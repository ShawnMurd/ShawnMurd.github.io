A website to host a variety of Meteorological Calculators

This website aims to provide users with a variety of easy-to-use tools that calculate various meteorological quantities.
The goal is not for the website to look pretty, rather the goal is for the website to be functional should the need arise to quickly
calculate a meteorological quantity.

Notes for Future Development:

~Fix menu so links that are clicked are not highlighted purple and so that the link responds when the cursor is hovered over it (use jQuery)

~Possibly add scripts for dynamic meteorolgical quantities (vorticity? divergence?)

~Add downloads for Python code that performs the same tasks

~Allow users to copy radiosonde data and have website plot a Skew-T
