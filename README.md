A website to host a variety of Meteorological Calculators

This website aims to provide users with a variety of easy-to-use tools that calculate various meteorological quantities.
The goal is not for the website to look pretty, rather the goal is for the website to be functional should the need arise to quickly
calculate a meteorological quantity.


Notes for Future Development:

~More jQuery magic?

~Create alerts the appear when user puts in crazy values (in order to prevent infinite loops)

~Possibly add scripts for dynamic meteorolgical quantities (vorticity? divergence?)

~Add downloads for Python code that performs the same tasks

~Allow users to copy radiosonde data and have website plot a Skew-T (use Canvas for scatterplot)

~Make equations more accurate by accounting for the change in the latent heat of vaporization with temperature
